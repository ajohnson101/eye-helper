Eye Helper Android App
=======================

This app aims to help blind people shop for groceries without assistance from store personnel. It is meant to run on Google Glass and Android smartphones. It includes video streaming and device communications to a [server](https://github.com/cypressf/eye-helper-server), which will do some cool computer vision, crowdsourcing, and machine learning shenanigans (stay tuned).

This project is part of [Olin College Crowdsourcing and Machine Learning](http://occam.olin.edu/).
